# 7. Test the admission controller

Finally, we get to test this admission controller.

## Set up

Let's create two namespaces:

```yaml
kubectl create namespace ns-with-validation
kubectl create namespace ns-free
```

And add the label we specified in our webhook to activate our Admission controller in the namespace we want to impose a limit to the number of replicas `ns-with-validation`: 

```shell
kubectl label namespace ns-with-validation k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io/assert-deployment-more-than-one-replicas=true
```

## Tests

Creating a one-replica deployment in the free namespace is ok:

```shell
# kubectl create deployment one-replica -n ns-free --image nginx --replicas=1
deployment.apps/one-replica created
```

Creating a one-replica deployment in the limited namespace is not ok: 

```shell
# kubectl create deployment one-replica -n ns-with-validation --image nginx --replicas=1
error: failed to create deployment: admission webhook "k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io" denied the request: Minimum number of replicas for a deployment is 2!
```

Creating a two-replica deployment in the limited namespace is ok: 

```shell
# kubectl create deployment two-replica -n ns-with-validation --image nginx --replicas=2
deployment.apps/two-replica created
```

## Troubleshooting

I had several issues during this creation. Here are they and an explanation of what went wrong:

### Certificate doesn't have Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field:

 ```shell
 # kubectl create deployment one-replica -n ns-with-validation --image nginx --replicas=1
 error: failed to create deployment: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io": failed to call webhook: Post "https://k8s-admission-demo.default.svc:443/validate?timeout=10s": x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
 ```

 Solution: Recreate certificate with SAN and redeploy 

### Application or service can't be reached:

 ```shell
 # kubectl create deployment one-replica -n ns-with-validation --image nginx --replicas=1
error: failed to create deployment: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io": failed to call webhook: Post "https://k8s-admission-demo.default.svc:443/validate?timeout=10s": dial tcp 192.166.0.141:443: connect: connection refused
 ```

Solution: Make sure deployment is running 

### The certificate is not valid for any names:

```shell
# kubectl create deployment one-replica -n ns-with-validation --image nginx --replicas=1
error: failed to create deployment: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io": failed to call webhook: Post "https://admission-demo.default.svc:443/validate?timeout=10s": x509: certificate is not valid for any names, but wanted to match admission-demo.default.svc
 ```
Solution: Make sure CN and SAN match the service name

### Invalid response, empty:

```shell
 error: failed to create deployment: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io": received invalid webhook response: expected response.uid="854e0949-c8cb-4cd8-8d5b-93608934f9d8", got ""
 ```

 Solution: If you don't specify a failure Policy to ignore you can't just return an empty response for a valid response. Make sure you return a valid AdmissionReview response with Response.allowed equals to true.

### Invalid response Kind and apiVersion:

```shell
 error: failed to create deployment: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io": received invalid webhook response: expected webhook response of admission.k8s.io/v1, Kind=AdmissionReview, got /, Kind=
 ```

Solution: In v1 AdmissionReview there is additional validation to make sure the Response and Request metadata [match](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/plugin/webhook/request/admissionreview.go).
