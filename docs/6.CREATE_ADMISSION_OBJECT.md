# 6. Create an Admissionregistration object that calls this Service for the right API action and Labeled Namespace

Now is the interesting part. Create the object that will register our application as a webhook to validate deployments.

First, we will need to charge the ca_bundle that we create in step 1 as an environment variable.

```yaml
CA_BUNDLE=$(cat certs/ca_bunddle)
```

Once that is set we can generate the webhook file:

```yaml
cat > webhook.yml << EOF
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: k8s-admission-demo
webhooks:
  - name: k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: k8s-admission-demo
        namespace: default
        path: "/validate"
      caBundle: "${CA_BUNDLE}"
    rules:
      - operations: ["CREATE"]
        apiGroups: ["apps"]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        resources: ["deployments"]
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io/assert-deployment-more-than-one-replicas: "true"
    sideEffects: None
    admissionReviewVersions:
      - v1
EOF
```

And create the object in Kubernetes:

```yaml
kubectl create -f webhook.yml
```

Here are some observations about each field of the webhook object:

- **name** - It needs to be a domain
- **clientConfig** - It needs to point to the service of our application and we need to provide the public certificate of the CA authority used to sign the application certificate.
- **rules** - A combination of Operations and Resource API groups that we want to validate. Only CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE and CONNECT are valid.
- **namespaceSelector** - Specification to limit the scope of this admission controller. The chosen label was `k8s-admission-demo.kubernetes.io/assert-deployment-more-than-one-replicas=true`.

You can learn more about each field with the explain command:

```yaml
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.name
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.clientConfig
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.rules
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.namespaceSelector
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.sideEffects
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks.admissionReviewVersions
kubectl explain ValidatingWebhookConfiguration.webhooks
```
