# 3. Build the application as a container image

To build the app as a container image we will create a simple [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile).

It consists of a multistage build with two stages:

- **Stage 1**: Install dependencies and build the app from a Golang image
- **Stage 2**: Copy the final binary into the runtime image 

You can build the image as follows:

```shell
docker build . -t k8s-admission-controller:latest
```

Test the image is running fine

If you try to run a container from this image without any argument it will try to load certificates from the default location. Since there is none in the image execution will fail:
```shell
docker run -it k8s-admission-controller

E0325 22:53:33.427023       1 main.go:32] Filed to load key pair: open /etc/certs/app.crt: no such file or directory
E0325 22:53:33.427023       1 main.go:32] glog: exiting because of error: log: cannot create log: open /tmp/k8s-admission-controller.2fbeb4dcab82.webhook.log.INFO.20230325-225333.1: no such file or directory
```
You can pass the local directory ($PWD) as a volume and mount it in the `/etc/certs` folder. Ex:

```shell
docker run -it -v $PWD/certs:/etc/certs k8s-admission-controller -logtostderr
```

Once you make sure the image is working as expected you can push it to your Container Registry (CR). In my case, that's `ghcr.io`.

Retag the image to match your CR:
```shell
 docker tag k8s-admission-controller ghcr.io/felipempda/k8s-admission-controller
```

Login to the CR with your user and Personal Access Token.
```shell
docker login 
```

And push the image:
```shell
docker push ghcr.io/felipempda/k8s-admission-controller
```

You can also set up a workflow to that automatically for you.
