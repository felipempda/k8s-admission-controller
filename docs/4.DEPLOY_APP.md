# 4. Deploy the application to Kubernetes

## Create Certificates

First, let's create a secret to store the certificate and key we just created in step 1:

```shell
kubectl create secret tls k8s-admission-demo-tls --cert=certs/app.crt --key=certs/app.key
```

## Create Deployment

I would like to create the app as a simple Deployment. 
Let,s first create a starting point to work:
```shell
kubectl create deployment k8s-admission-demo --image ghcr.io/felipempda/k8s-admission-controller --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

That will generate the following template:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: k8s-admission-demo
  name: k8s-admission-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: k8s-admission-demo
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: k8s-admission-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ghcr.io/felipempda/k8s-admission-controller
        name: k8s-admission-controller
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

We need to mount the secret as a volume in the /etc/certs/ folder. Here is the next step:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: k8s-admission-demo
  name: k8s-admission-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: k8s-admission-demo
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: k8s-admission-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ghcr.io/felipempda/k8s-admission-controller
        name: k8s-admission-controller
        resources: {}
        volumeMounts: 
          - name: certs
            mountPath: /etc/certs/
      volumes:
        - name: certs
          secret: 
            secretName: k8s-admission-demo-tls
status: {}
```

If you try to deploy that as it is:
```yaml
kubectl create -f Deployment.yml
```

Make sure the deployment is running fine:

```shell
kubectl get pod -l app=k8s-admission-demo
```

In my case there is a problem, let's see what that was:
```yaml
NAME                                 READY   STATUS             RESTARTS      AGE
k8s-admission-demo-7b58bf558-nsg86   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   1 (10s ago)   13s
```

When I consult the logs:

```shell
kubectl logs -l app=k8s-admission-demo
```

Certificates are biting me in the face:

```yaml
E0325 23:56:28.118143       1 main.go:32] Filed to load key pair: open /etc/certs/app.crt: no such file or directory
E0325 23:56:28.118143       1 main.go:32] glog: exiting because of error: log: cannot create log: open /tmp/k8s-admission-controller.k8s-admission-demo-7b58bf558-nsg86.webhook.log.INFO.20230325-235628.1: no such file or directory
```

This is because files were mounted with names different than the defaults coded in the app:

```yaml
# kubectl exec -it k8s-admission-demo-<TAB> -- sh

# cd /etc/certs
# ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 Mar 26 00:06 tls.crt -> ..data/tls.crt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 Mar 26 00:06 tls.key -> ..data/tls.key
```

Also, there is no /tmp folder in the container, we can fix that by changing logs to standard error. Let's fix the deployment and pass these files as arguments:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: k8s-admission-demo
  name: k8s-admission-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: k8s-admission-demo
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: k8s-admission-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ghcr.io/felipempda/k8s-admission-controller
        name: k8s-admission-controller
        args:
          - --cert
          - /etc/certs/tls.crt
          - --key
          - /etc/certs/tls.key
          - -logtostderr
        resources: {}
        volumeMounts:
          - name: certs
            mountPath: /etc/certs
      volumes:
        - name: certs
          secret:
            secretName: k8s-admission-demo-tls
status: {}
```

After fixing this error, we can see pod is running fine:

```yaml
# kubectl get pod -l app=k8s-admission-demo
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
k8s-admission-demo-f8d66f6cc-hkk4f   1/1     Running   0          11s
```

Now logs are saying what we wanted to see:

```yaml
# kubectl logs -l app=k8s-admission-demo
I0326 00:15:59.132156       1 main.go:53] Server running listening in port: 9000
```
