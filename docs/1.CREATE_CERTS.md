# 1. Create SSL Certificates for CA and App 

We will need a Certificate Authority (CA) and an application certificate
sdf

## Generate CA Key and Certificate

Generate a private key for the CA:

```shell
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
```

Generate the configuration for the CA certificate:

```shell
cat > ca_config << EOF
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
default_md         = sha512
default_keyfile    = ca.key
prompt             = no
encrypt_key        = yes

# base request
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name

# distinguished_name
[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName            = "CA"                     # C=
stateOrProvinceName    = "Quebec"                 # ST=
localityName           = "Quebec"                 # L=
organizationName       = "Org "                   # O=
organizationalUnitName = "Unit"                   # OU=
commonName             = "Common"                 # CN=
emailAddress           = "no-reply@notexist"      # CN/emailAddress=
EOF
```

Generate a public certificate for the CA:

```shell
openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -config ca_config
```

## Generate Application Key, CSR and Certificate

The admission controller app will need to have a certificate signed by a valid CA, in this case, the one we have just created.

Generate a private key for the app:

```shell
openssl genrsa -out app.key 2048
```

Generate a certificate request (CSR) for the app. The CN would have to match the Service Name qualified name that will be created later on:

```shell
openssl req -new -key app.key -subj "/CN=admission-demo.default.svc" -out app.csr
```

And finally, sign this CSR with the CA key to generate a public certificate for the app:

```shell
openssl x509 -req -in app.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out app.crt
```

## Create CA_BUNDLE for the CA certificate

Since this CA is unknown to Kubernetes we need to provide its public certificate so Kubernetes can validate the application certificate. Let's create a base64 encoded format for the CA.

```shell
cat ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n' > ca_bundle
```

## Result

Generated files:

```shell
app.crt
app.csr
app.key
ca.crt
ca.key
ca.srl
ca_bundle
ca_config
```
