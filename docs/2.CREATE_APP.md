# 2. Create an application with the Admission Logic

The application could be created in any language. Go is the obvious choice since it's the language Kubernetes was built into. 

App Logic consists of the following:

- Webserver listening on a given port.
- It receives an AdmissionReview request.
- It unloads this payload and expects to find a Deployment
- It exists if `Deployment.Spec.Replicas` are more than one
- If sends an error message otherwise
